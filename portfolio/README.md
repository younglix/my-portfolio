# My Portfolio & Rider Workflow Demo

Hi there! 👋 Welcome to my personal portfolio repository.  

This site is my little corner to **showcase my skills as a backend developer**. It’s built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and includes some fun interactive demos — including a **Rider Order Workflow Demo** that simulates a delivery system in action.

## 🌟 Pages You’ll Find Here

### **Home (`index.html`)**
A quick introduction about me, my experience, and the technologies I love to work with — like Python, Django, Flask, PostgreSQL, and SQLAlchemy.

### **About Me (`about.html`)**
Dive a bit deeper into my background, professional journey, and technical strengths.

### **Projects (`projects.html`)**
A showcase of my work. Each project comes with a short description and a **“View Demo”** button for interactive ones, like the Rider App. It’s a way to see my skills in action!

### **Architecture (`architecture.html`)**
I share my thoughts on backend design, scalable architectures, and how I approach building systems that are both robust and maintainable.

### **Rider Demo (`Isaac.html`)**
This is the interactive part — my take on a rider delivery workflow app. You can:
- Add a new order
- Track the order step by step
- See timestamps for each step
- Check completed orders in a persistent history
- Read a built-in description of how it all works

It’s a small frontend simulation, but it mirrors **real backend logic** like state machines, order modeling, and workflow enforcement.

## 💡 Why I Built It This Way

- To **show backend thinking** in a frontend simulation
- To demonstrate **state management, persistence, and workflow logic**
- To make a portfolio that’s **interactive, recruiter-friendly, and fun to explore**

Even though it’s all in HTML/JS, it’s designed to **look and feel like a real-world delivery system** you might find in production.
